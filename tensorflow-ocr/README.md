# tensorflow-ocr
ðŸ–º OCR using tensorflow with attention

*This is an experimental project and not ready for production in any sense*

However if you are a student or otherwise interested in artificial intelligence technology this might be interesting for you.
especially since you can detect the text under your mouse pointer with `mouse_prediction.py`

To get started with a minimal example similar to the famous MNIST try
`./train_letters.py` ;
it automatically generates letters for all different font types from your computer in all different shapes and trains on it.
